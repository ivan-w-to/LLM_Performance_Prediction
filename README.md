# LLM Performance Prediction

As the final project for Harvard's Statistics 139 course, three classmates and I uilt a linear model to predict the MMLU performance of large language models (LLMs) using CO2 emissions, number of parameters, and the like. We reached an adjusted R-squared value of 99.77 (i.e. model explains 99.77% of the dataset's variance even after adjusting for number of predictors).
